            <h1>Coffee</h1>
            <p>Coffee, beverage brewed from the roasted and ground seeds of the tropical evergreen coffee plants of African origin. Coffee is one of the three most popular beverages in the world (alongside water and tea) and one of the most profitable international commodities. Though coffee is the basis for an endless array of beverages, including espresso, cappuccinos, mochas, and lattes, its popularity is mainly attributed to its invigorating effect, which is produced by caffeine, an alkaloid present in coffee.</p>

            <h1>Yerba Mate</h1>
            <p>Yerba mate is an herbal tea made from the leaves and stems of the Ilex paraguariensis plant.

                The leaves are typically dried over a fire, then steeped in hot water to make the tea.
                
                Yerba mate is traditionally consumed from a container called a gourd and sipped with a metal straw that has a filter at its lower end to strain out the leaf fragments.
                
                Sharing it from this traditional gourd is said to be a sign of friendship and bonding.</p>

            <h1>Tea</h1>
            <p>Tea is the most popular beverage in the world after water. It's a simple preparation of pouring hot water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. The first recording of tea described it as a medicinal beverage in China in the 3rd century AD. Merchants helped its popularity to spread quickly across continents. In the early 19th century, Great Britain popularized the concept of afternoon tea, a break from oneâ€™s routine in which tea is served alongside sandwiches and baked goods such as scones. The flavor of tea varies by where the tea leaves are harvested and how they are grown and processed. Black tea is the most popular worldwide, followed by green, oolong, and white tea.</p>
