# B2 CRUD
Welcome to my B2 Crud assignment. When it comes to my code, it has a MVC architecture, with a .env file for your db connection link, and an app.js file to run the application.

# How to run the app:
After cloning the repository, you have to install the dependencies and then you can run the app.
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install


# Running the Applicaiton:
1. Start by locating the .env file and adding the link to your database. An example could be:
```bash
'mongodb+srv://yy222bz:Yousef_2002@cluster0.wlamsee.mongodb.net/'
```

2.
Use npm start with your desired url:
```bash
npm start 
```
